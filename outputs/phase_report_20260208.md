# Weekly Status Report — 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-08

## Bottom Line
Strategy is **operational** with 9.8% annualized return and Sharpe ratio of 0.82 (meets the 0.50 target). Risk margin is 1.1% above limit — adequate but needs monitoring.

## Project Health

| Area | Status | Trend | Note |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| Strategy Performance | 🟢 | → | Sharpe 0.82 vs 0.50 target |
| Risk Management | 🟢 | → | Max drawdown -23.9% vs -25% limit |
| Validation Progress | 🔴 | ↑ | 3/10 experiments complete |
| Quality Assurance | 🔴 | → | 119 tests, 4 modules untested |

## This Week
- Phase 1 — signal diversification (regime, vol, mean-reversion, composite)
- Improved project documentation and knowledge management infrastructure
- Established automated code review process to maintain code quality standards
- Phase 0 — risk overlay, cost sensitivity (Exp 05), parameter stability (Exp 07)
- create Alex — management reporting agent
- 深度评估项目现状与发展路线图

## Issues & Mitigations
- **Thin risk margin** (1.1% buffer to drawdown limit): Implementing automated risk overlay with drawdown controls
- **Experiment 03 (Carry Signal Validation)** did not pass validation: Redirecting effort to higher-priority items; no development time wasted on unviable approach
- **Experiment 05 (Transaction Cost Sensitivity)** did not pass validation: Redirecting effort to higher-priority items; no development time wasted on unviable approach
- **Experiment 07 (Parameter Stability Walk-Forward)** did not pass validation: Redirecting effort to higher-priority items; no development time wasted on unviable approach
- **Test coverage gap** (modules without tests: backtest, portfolio, data, diagnostics): Scheduling test development before next feature additions

## Next Steps
1. Complete transaction cost validation (Exp 5) — confirms strategy viability under realistic conditions
2. Complete parameter stability test (Exp 7) — validates strategy robustness over time
3. Implement risk overlay — automated drawdown protection to widen safety margin

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | vs Benchmark | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Annualized Return | 9.8% | >8% | +48% | 🟢 |
| Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe) | 0.82 | >0.50 | +44% | 🟢 |
| Max Drawdown | -23.9% | >-25% | -34% better | 🟢 |
| Validation Progress | 3/10 | 10/10 | — | 🔴 |
| Test Coverage | 20% | >80% | — | 🔴 |
